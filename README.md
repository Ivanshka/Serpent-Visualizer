# Serpent Visualizer
Serpent Visualizer is small visualizer of Serpent cipher developed with C++ and SFML library. It can help you better understand how this cipher works. You need only create data file & key file and open this program. If you did it alright, you will see small visualization of encrypting entered data by entered key.
### Files
- data.txt: enter 1 block of Serpent cipher i.e. 16 characters (16 bytes = 128 bits)
- key.txt: enter a key up to 32 characters long (i.e. 32 bytes = 256 bits)
